# Weather Hub

Welcome to the **Weather Hub** project, a collaborative initiative for schools within the CIJE network. This project aims to empower students and educators to build and deploy their own weather stations using various wireless technologies, such as the ESP32, to collect and share weather data.

## Project Overview

The Weather Hub project provides all the necessary documents, code, and supporting files to build weather stations capable of transmitting real-time weather data to a centralized MySQL database. The weather stations will connect using technologies such as **JSON** and **AJAX** to ensure seamless data transmission and storage.

## Features

- **Wireless Communication**: Utilize the ESP32 or similar microcontrollers to collect and transmit weather data.
- **Real-Time Data**: Transmit data in real-time using JSON and AJAX to a MySQL database.
- **Data Visualization**: Example code is provided to display weather data locally on devices or web interfaces.
- **Centralized Data Hub**: All weather stations will send their data to a centralized MySQL database accessible at [CIJE Weather Hub](https://cijeweatherhub.site).
- **Easy Registration**: After building a weather station, students and educators must register their station at [CIJE Weather Hub](https://cijeweatherhub.site) with a unique name and location (either by zip code or latitude/longitude).
- **Public Data Access**: View and analyze weather data collected from all registered stations across the CIJE network at [CIJE Weather Hub](https://cijeweatherhub.site).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of electronics and programming.
- Access to an ESP32 or a similar microcontroller.
- An active Wi-Fi network.
- MySQL database access (optional for local setup).

### Installation

1. **Clone this Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-hub.git
2. **Build the Weather Station**

- Follow the provided documentation in the `/docs` folder to assemble your weather station.

3. **Flash the ESP32

- Use the example code provided in the `/code` folder to program your ESP32.

4. **Register Your Weather Station

- After assembly and programming, register your weather station at [CIJE Weather Hub](https://cijeweatherhub.site) with a unique name and location.

5. **Monitor Data

- Once registered, your weather station will begin transmitting data to the CIJE Weather Hub. You can monitor the data in real-time at [CIJE Weather Hub](https://cijeweatherhub.site).
